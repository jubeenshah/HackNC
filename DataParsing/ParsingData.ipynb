We used a spicer chili sauce than mentioned with fantastic results! Thanks for sharing!\\n11953,101823,88453,2004-06-15,5,\"This chicken was incredibly succulent. I was missing celery seeds, and therefore subbed celery salt for the seeds and salt required in the recipe. I also increased the hot pepper sauce slightly. I prepared this with boneless, skinless chicken breasts, and basted very frequently while grilling. Without the skin and bones, my grilling time was naturally shorter. My hubby loved the flavor of this sauce and liked that I had reserved some for dipping the finished chicken. I also roasted corn on the cob, tossed a salad and made Grilled Ranch Bread (recipe#93249) for a complete meal. It was delicious and perfect for a summer evening.\\r\\nUPDATE***The next evening, I had some pork loin chops defrosted for dinner.  When I asked Hubby how he wanted them prepared, he requested that we grill them with this bbq sauce.  The flavor was awesome.  He thinks that we should never purchase bottled sauce again.:D\"\\n11954,29014,88453,2004-07-12,5,\"Finger-lickin\\' good!!  Made the recipe exactly as posted.  Only complaint would be to make more sauce (and I would definitely try it with pork as mentioned in another review!).  I had all the ingredients on hand and we used a whole chicken, cut up.  Served with grilled taters-n-onions, and steamed green beans.  Thanks for posting, DDW!\"\\n11955,149043,88453,2004-09-06,5,\"Very moist chicken and the sauce is delicious. I didn\\'t following the grilling instructions at all and baked the chicken breasts ( 8 of them) covered in foil for 50 minutes.  I then uncovered, turned on the broiler, marinated the breasts every five minutes for fifteen minutes and they were wonderful.  Thank you!     \"\\n11956,195285,88453,2005-02-25,5,Delicious sauce. Sweet but not too much so. Will definitely enjoy making it again.\\n11957,52125,88453,2005-03-29,5,\"I didn\\'t grill the chicken as its to cold outside right now. I baked and then broiled the chicken and it still turned out wonderful! I will use the grill and make this chicken again when the weather warms.\\r\\nThanks DDW....\"\\n11958,192965,88453,2005-05-13,5,\"Just an amazing sauce, I used this on my pork spareribs, only I doubled the sauce. Served with grilled vegetable skewers, jalapeno cornbread and a fruit salad. What a meal!\"\\n11959,37092,88453,2009-05-26,5,Excellent!  I didn\\'t buy Ketchup (thinking I had enough) so I only had 1/2 c and used an extra 1/2 c of the chili sauce instead.  It still turned out fantastic.  Thank-you.\\n11960,121684,88453,2005-05-29,5,\"I was a bit concerned about using chilli sauce in this recipe as we don\\'t like our food too hot.  But, I bought some mild chilli sauce and it was just fine - in fact, it could have done with a bit more heat.  I made a double quantity of the marinade and used half of it to marinade a whole 2.1kg chicken cut into serving pieces, overnight. The other half of the marinade I reserved for basting. The next day I barbecued most of the chicken pieces, covered on a rack for about 45 minutes (basting frequently).  I finished them off by grilling directly on the barbecue but found the marinade tended to burn so I only cooked briefly on the direct heat.  The chicken was beautifully tender and moist and very tasty.  The left-over raw chicken, I cooked the next day in the oven at 180C (350F).  I placed them on a rack in a roasting tin, covered with foil and a lid for 45 minutes (basting every 15 minutes) and then uncovered for 15-20 minutes.  Both versions were delicious, but barbecued was best.  Left-overs reheated well in the microwave.  Thanks for a great recipe which we\\'ll use often for family barbecues.\"\\n11961,89831,88453,2005-06-19,5,\"Just the sauce alone is worth more than 5 stars! I made up the sauce late last night and then left it in the fridge to blend the flavors overnight, this morning I marinated the chicken breasts IN the sauce all day, and then threw them on the grill tonight, I boiled the extra sauce to baste with while grilling...simply  delicious! my son, his girlfriend  and myself gave this 6 thumbs up LOL! the chicken went wonderful with my Greek Salad recipe...thanks DDW for a really great recipe, I will be making the sauce for a lot of other recipes also!....Kittencal:)\"\\n11962,176481,88453,2005-07-03,4,\"My boyfriend and I love to grill and love BBQ chicken, so we thought we\\'d give a new recipe a try.  We feel that brining meats before grilling makes them juicy and tender, haven\\'t been wrong yet.  We followed the sauce instructions exact but feel that there was too much ketchup in the taste.  I would have liked a bit more smokey flavor or a bit more kick.  I did like the way it stuck to the chicken.  I would say all in all this recipe wasn\\'t bad, worth a try for others.\"\\n11963,228032,88453,2005-08-14,5,\"Yummmers!\\r\\nI used the recipe to make a test run for the sauce.\\r\\nWe used it for some chicken legs we had bar b q\\'d (easier for my boys to eat legs rather than breasts) =)\\r\\nAnywhoo....Delish!!!\\r\\nMy husband asked me to make a large jar for the fridge.\\r\\nI did!\\r\\nBest BBQ sauce I have EVER had and I am in TX where they sale sauce in malls, lol\\r\\nMust Try!\"\\n11964,238580,88453,2005-08-24,5,\"This one\\'s a keeper!\\r\\nFollowed the recipe as posted and added two cap fulls of liquid smoke.\\r\\nThis clings to the meat like a dog on a bone. Beats 99.9% of most comercial sauces. I can\\'t believe how good it was. It could possibly be a marital aid condement. \"\\n11965,33722,88453,2005-08-29,5,I would give this 10 stars if I could. It was absolutely wonderful!!! Thanks for sharing.\\n11966,114629,88453,2006-01-10,4,Tasty. A bit too sweet for me but the brown sugar is tasty. Real mustard in place of the generic prepared variety is an improvement.\\n11967,147027,88453,2007-02-11,5,\"This really was fantastic. What I did - I bought a whole chicken and got my butcher to cut it up for me. I then marinated in half the bbq sauce for a few hours and roasted at 180c for an hour, turning at about 40 mins to avoid the marinade burning. I also basted a few times with the leftover marinade. We did have some of the extra sauce with it and it was great - I used extra hot chilli sauce to make sure it would have enough punch for our taste! Next day I spread the rest of the sauce on a pizza base, topped with tomatoes, leftover bbq chicken, red onion, feta, pineapple and cheese - yummo all round, thanks for an ace recipe!\"\\n11968,273456,88453,2007-04-24,5,\"This was fabulous. I only changed the amount of garlic-doubled it with big cloves and more hot sauce. I don\\'t baste either but put the done chicken in a pan, cover with the sauce and let simmer on the grill or in  the oven on low for 15 to 20 minutes or so. My Husband is still talking about how good the sauce was  and I should have made more for dipping. I will not be buying store bought sauce again. Will be making this next time with pork steaks. Thanks for the great recipe.\"\\n11969,128950,88453,2007-05-01,4,I used boneless skinless breasts that I had brined and they were fantastic and juicy.  I would definitely recommend doubling the sauce.  You will want more in the end!!!\\n11970,88569,88453,2007-05-26,5,\"This sauce is wonderful.  I don\\'t even like barbeque sauce that much, but the reviews all seemed so good that I decided to try it anyway...good thing I did, because everyone loved it. I doubled the sauce and used 2lbs boneless skinless chicken breast. Yum, thanks!\"\\n11971,166636,88453,2007-07-01,5,\"I just used this over the weekend on chicken and served 50 with rave reviews!  It is sweet, but still tangy - really delicious.  Thanks!\"\\n11972,330937,88453,2007-08-07,4,\"I\\'m not sure it was the \"\"best ever\"\" but people did seem to like it at a recent BBQ\"\\n11973,507071,88453,2007-09-03,5,Awesome!\\n11974,185446,88453,2007-12-09,4,\"Too cold to BBQ around here, so followed other reviewers\\' baking suggestions.  The chicken was moist, and the sauce was great.  Can\\'t wait to try it the right way this summer.  Thanks, DDW!\"\\n11975,431716,88453,2008-02-02,4,\"I was just looking for a BBQ sauce for some ribs I was cooking so didn\\'t use this on the chicken. Both my hubby & I liked it. I did add a bit more brown sugar as I thought it was a little tart but that is just personal preference.\\r\\nThanks for a good recipe DDW.\"\\n11976,160205,88453,2008-05-27,5,This was great!  I used my new grill for the first time with this recipe and even my picky husband told me to make sure I didn\\'t lose the BBQ sauce recipe!  (And he\\'s an A1 guy.)  I omitted the celery seeds only because I didn\\'t have them but it came out great!\\n11977,339280,88453,2008-05-27,5,\"Made this yesterday as well, and it was wonderful.  The only change ,if you want to call it a change was I added a few shakes of Liquid Smoke.  I was using a gas grille and I add it a lot, as a \"\"fake out\"\" to a wood fire.  I had cut up a whole chicken and every piece was delish!  Thank you again for posting.\\r\\nLeslie\"\\n11978,288670,88453,2008-06-01,5,\"WONDERFUL!!! We usually don\\'t like BBQ sauce but this is definately a keeper! I am always asked for the recipe when I make this for people. I don\\'t put in the hot pepper sauce, but other than that I wouldn\\'t change a thing!!!Thanks for such a great recipe!!\"\\n11979,148715,88453,2008-06-03,5,\"This ws the best BBQ sauce I have ever made. This is the new summer standard in our family.  Update06/02/08, I went to make this one day and half way through found out that my bottle of chili sauce was put back in the fridge empty.  I had some leftover cocktail sauce so I threw that in instead and it was still great.  Since then I have really played with adding extra spices to this depending on my mood.  Today I added some Kraft Roasted Red Pepper salad dressing, a few drops of liquid smoke and some oregano to it.  Yummy.\"\\n11980,93006,88453,2008-06-15,4,\"Good mopping sauce, juicy chicken.  Maybe I\\'ll double the sauce next time so that more of the flavor of the sauce comes through.\"\\n11981,123037,88453,2008-06-26,5,\"YUMMMMYYYY !!!!!  I roasted the chicken beforehand with a commercial bought rub, let it cool for a few hours and brought it out to the bbq that evening and grilled it for about 15 minutes before smothering it with sauce. It was amazing ! Best bbq chicken my family and I ever had !!!!!!\"\\n11982,674484,88453,2008-06-27,5,\"Yup, you definately have to make more sauce than in the recipe it\\'s so good!  I used a little more hot pepper sauce, but other than that made the same as the recipe.  This will be made again and again at my house.  Loved it!\"\\n11983,353491,88453,2008-06-29,4,\"We liked this sauce very much.\\nI tinkered with it just a wee bit.\\nI added a dollop of honey, another couple tsp butter, and \\nmaybe 1/4 C red wine (Shiraz).\\nMy DH and DD are very particular and they both enjoyed this sauce.\\nThanks for a real keeper.\"\\n11984,684840,88453,2008-07-05,4,Made recipe just as listed and it came out good. I think next time I will cut back on the celery seed. Thanks for a good recipe.\\n11985,281399,88453,2008-07-07,5,\"Ok you *wow* ed me. We all loved this bbq chicken.  The extra for dipping just put this over the top! I used home made chili sauce. I  used bone-in chicken breast and with your cooking instructions they turned out perfect. I think this would be great dipping sauce for chicken nuggets as well.  Thanks for posting this recipe, one that we will be making again and soon. Made for the Grilling and BBQ challenge in the cooking photo. forum.\"\\n11986,460224,88453,2008-07-08,5,Finger-lickin good!\\n11987,649173,88453,2008-07-10,5,\"This is a most fabulous sauce, to be sure!  I used it on chicken qtrs., added a bit of onion powder to the sauce, used 1 tbls. Worcesteshire (I don\\'t really care for it) and a touch of Liquid Smoke.  I did double the recipe, and am serving leftover sauce with grilled pork tonight.  Purrrfect!  Thanks so much!\"\\n11988,362919,88453,2008-08-13,5,\"Since I was sharing the oven, I couldn\\'t get a good sticky glaze on the chicken like I wanted too... unless I wanted to wait for it to cool down so the broiler would turn on. Despite that, the sauce was amazing. I left the sauce amounts alone but only cooked two breasts, and used almost all of the sauce so I would defiantly double or triple it for more.\"\\n11989,595630,88453,2008-09-02,5,Only BBQ sauce recipe my husband and I have tried that we actually liked! So good! We always have extra for dipping. Heinz ketchup & chili sauce is a must for us also!\\n11990,369715,88453,2008-09-08,5,\"Very good. I followed the recipe as written other then I didn\\'t use butter to cook the garlic, I used pam. I also used splenda brown sugar as that is all I buy. I didn\\'t add the celery seed as I didn\\'t have any. I used 8 boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I put some of the sauce on the bottom of a 13x9 pan and placed the  breasts on top. I then topped with the rest of the sauce. I then cooked on the grill for 30 minutes covered. They were perfect and everyone enjoyed them.\"\\n11991,187281,88453,2008-09-20,5,\"We thought this sauce was indeed great.  I couldn\\'t grill the chicken so I pour the sauce over and baked slowly at 300 degrees for about 1.5 hours.  The sauce is nice because it\\'s actually thick enough to stick to the chicken.  I added the full amount of celery seed but I would reduce that because it was a little stronger flavor than we wanted.  Overall, a fantastic chicken recipe and once we\\'ll make again for sure.\"\\n11992,235355,88453,2008-09-27,4,Very very good!  I needed a last minute BBQ recipe and this one fit the bill.  I love the thickness of the sauce and the sweet/tangy flavor.  There was one flavor that I wasn\\'t completely in love with and I think that may have been the mustard - maybe I\\'ll try it without that next time.  All in all an excellent recipe!\\n11993,542891,88453,2009-01-07,5,very good bbq chicken! even my 2 year old ate it and she rarely eats meat. we baked them in the oven as it is the dead of winter in iowa!\\n11994,416645,88453,2009-01-13,5,\"I made this several times now, amazing!!! BBQ in winter with some friends over, it was a huge hit, thanks!!! The only thing I did different was I added more hot sauce since my husband likes it hot :)\"\\n11995,66246,88453,2009-03-28,5,\"This recipe is a winner.  Made it exactly as written and wouldn\\'t change a thing.  I BBQ 4 boneless skinless chicken breast and they were tender, moist and delicious.\"\\n11996,985766,88453,2009-04-10,5,What a great barbecue chicken!  Every one of us thought it was the bomb!\\n11997,484436,88453,2009-04-25,5,\"Great recipe, will be using it a lot in summer. the chicken was incredibly tender and moist. had no celery seed and used nothing in its place.\"\\n11998,722743,88453,2009-06-09,5,this was really great and easy... loved the sauce for dippin!!\\n11999,358335,88453,2009-06-11,0,I just grilled some boneless chicken breast with this sauce and all I can say is FANTASTIC!  I kept licking the bowl.  Be sure to make enough for dipping this is the die for all bbq sauces.\\n12000,457829,88453,2009-06-16,5,this was awesome great tasting very good bbq sauce juicy tender i grilled bone in chicken pieces but before grilling i marinated the chicken for 4 hours i will be making this often thanks again\\n12001,286851,88453,2009-07-05,5,\"My husband and I made this last week, and we really enjoyed it. I used split chicken breasts (skin on), which we had never grilled with before, but they worked great--hubby said they were so easy to grill. Sauce was yummy--we saved some on the side to dip into. Chicken was extremely moist and juicy. Will definitely make again. One package of split breasts that I purchased had 3 breasts. Was enough for 4 of us--hubby and I and our two small children split one. One large split chicken breast is plenty for one person, for planning purposes. Thanks for sharing a great new grilling recipe for us. Looking forward to making it again.\"\\n12002,850537,88453,2009-07-05,5,The Best BBQ Sauce I\\'ve ever had.  I\\'ve made it on 5 occasions now and everyone that has been lucky enough to try it has been a fan.  Thanks for sharing!!!\\n12003,781247,88453,2009-08-04,5,\"This is an excellent recipe for bbq sauce!  I had a total of 25 people from 5 different countries, and they all loved it.\\n\\nI made a few changes though.  First, I substituted red palm sugar for the brown sugar.  Second, I didn\\'t have any hot pepper sauce like Tabasco, but since Tabasco has a lot of vinegar in it I added a few drops of 25% acetic acid vinegar to add a little tangy-ness to the flavor.  Finally, after tasting the finished product it tasted a little too much like catchup and not spicy enough, so I ground up 8-10 red birds-eye chilies to a fine paste and added it into the sauce.\"\\n12004,1263528,88453,2009-08-09,5,\"I think the chili sauce I used was a bit too hot for us.  Next time I will try it with a milder one.  However, even though I made it too spicy I thought overall the rest of the flavors were delicious.  This is a keeper.  Thank you.\"\\n12005,740480,88453,2009-11-05,5,This has become the only BBQ sauce I make...it\\'s the best!\\n12006,470351,88453,2009-11-08,5,Un-freaking-believable!  I\\'m a BBQ sauce afficionado and this pretty much tops them all.  I make a homemade BBQ sauce for my BBQ ribs that I thought could not be beat and this may either be equal or better!  It\\'s THAT good!   I tripled the garlic and 1.5\\'d the whole recipe.  I added a lot more than 2 dashes of hot pepper sauce. I used this on boneless skinless chicken breasts.  TO DIE FOR!   SO AMAZING!  MUST TRY!\\n12007,1386745,88453,2009-12-08,4,Thanks for this!  It was great and I happened to have everything for it already.  We loved it!\\n12008,206485,88453,2010-01-24,4,\"Not bad at all. The best I\\'ve had though had an additional smokey, hickory & mesquite flavor to it from Bone Daddy\\'s BBQ in Midland, MI of all places.\"\\n12009,1570466,88453,2010-03-06,5,This was great... I wouldnt suggest not putting in the celery seeds because I could really taste a difference... and I would also suggest using the Heinz ketchup as suggested (though I used a generic brand of chili sauce)... I marinated for a few hours before hand and did double the recipe... this recipe is definitely a keeper!\\n12010,1584068,88453,2010-03-25,5,\"This was an absolutely amazing recipe.  I followed it to the letter and the smell that radiated throughout the house brought my roommates out to investigate.  If you live with roommates, I would recommend making enough for them too or trust me you will have a ton of angry and disappointed indivuals.  Thanks sooooooooooo much for such an easy and amazing recipe!\"\\n12011,129314,88453,2010-03-31,5,\"This recipe makes the best BBQ that I have ever had. The sauce is just delicious.We used bone-in skin-on chicken breasts and they were out of this world! Thank you so much for sharing this, it is the only BBQ chicken recipe I will use!\"\\n12012,1244621,88453,2010-04-07,5,We LOVED this recipe!  The BBQ sauce is delicious.  Thanks!\\n12013,158086,88453,2010-05-02,5,This was the  best bbq chicken I have ever made...loved the sauce..the only thing I changed was I used sugar free brown sugar...otherwise followed the recipe exactly....\\n12014,684049,88453,2010-05-24,4,\"very good, next time i will stay closer to 12 tbls or celey seed tho. thanks\"\\n12015,100811,88453,2010-05-25,5,\"Thinking I found a new favorite. Made exactly as stated except I did not have any Worcestershire sauce so substituted with 2 tablespoons of Original Bullseye BBQ Sauce. Cooling on the counter and have to keep myself from \"\"just one more little taste\"\" everytime I walk by. Dinner tonight - BBQ Chicken Pizza. Yummo.\"\\n12016,2335307,88453,2012-07-19,0,I made this tonight for dinner and I was almost tempted to lick the sauce right out of the pan. It was yummy! And my whole family loved it! Not only was it a healthy meal but a delicious one as well.\\n12017,1321641,88453,2010-06-01,5,\"The name says it all.  I made this over Memorial day weekend; it really IS that good... the sauce is super simple, but don\\'t let that fool you, it\\'s got PLENTY to make your taste buds dance.  I did brine the chicken first (soaked in salt water for 30-45 minutes; IMO this helps keep the chicken juicy during the long grilling process).\\r\\n\\r\\nThis recipe just went into the secret \"\"things to impress my friends\"\" with notebook.  I\\'ll be making this one again; really soon.\"\\n12018,125388,88453,2010-06-06,5,\"Made as directed and yes, this is an excellent BBQ sauce for chicken.  I had only 4 chicken breasts, but made the full amount of sauce so we had plenty for dipping.  Really excellent flavor.\"\\n12019,1412178,88453,2010-06-07,3,I thought this recipe was just \\'ok\\'.  I\\'ve found many bottled sauces that I perfer.  I would not make this again.  I thought the flavors were too tangy.\\n12020,303446,88453,2010-06-11,5,Very good BBQ sauce. It was tasted great on our grilled chicken. My husband said it was even better the next day. My 5 yr old kept licking her fingers and asking for more. Thank you. We will definately use this recipe again. :)\\n12021,583455,88453,2010-06-12,5,great sauce - everyone loved it!\\n12022,604714,88453,2010-06-14,4,\"I thought it was pretty good.  I think I will follow one of the reviewers and use celery salt instead of seeds.  I didn\\'t like encountering one when eating.  Too strong I thought.  I added some finely diced onion, only because I had some left from another recipe I was making at the same time.  Turned out nice.  I may try this sauce on some ribs.\"\\n12023,311926,88453,2010-06-23,5,This recipe *is* just delicious! I didn\\'t have the chili sauce so I left it out and it was still very yummy. This is definitely my \\'go to\\' BBQ sauce recipe from now on! Thanks for a great recipe - now to defrost the ribs!!\\n12024,620763,88453,2010-07-08,5,\"I really liked this BBQ sauce. You can really taste the chili sauce in it, which makes it different than other sauces.\"\\n12025,1535375,88453,2010-08-01,5,\"This has to be the most wonderful BBQ chicken recipe,  very tasty and a just<br/>the right amount of spicy flavor.\"\\n12026,1667846,88453,2010-08-21,5,\"I love BBQ and this was a very special recipe as I had the same doubts concerning all the Ketchup (like FancyFish), but the try was worth it and I am delighted. Will do it again!\"\\n12027,103876,88453,2011-03-09,5,\"Made this barbecue sauce for some boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I didn\\'t have chili sauce so just substituted some sweet bbq sauce and a little all-spice.  The sauce was really good on the grilled chicken and my whole family enjoyed.  Thanks for posting!\"\\n12028,1206650,88453,2011-03-28,5,We made this tonight and my husband loved it. Followed the cooking instructions but when it came to putting the sauce together I did not bother measuring the ingredients. I used a garlic chili sauce and it turned out great. Will make again. Also have a picture that I will upload.\\n12029,178452,88453,2011-05-30,5,\"This truly is a great recipe.  Not to sweet or overbaring.    I made it exactly as written and my fussy eaters loved it.  I used 7 half boneless chicken breasts and had plenty sauce to dip with.  I made the sauce first and then pounded the breasts to about an inch thick.  Seared the breasts on each side then coated the top side with sauce grilled for 5 mins, turned and coated the second side and grilled for 5 mins.  Perfection!!!!   I kept the remaining breast in the refrig and made a great salad the next day with  - romaine lettuce bagged mix, yellow sweet bell peppers, red seedless grapes and cubed cold chicken.  We don\\'t use salad dressing on any of our salads as we like the taste of the salad alone.  I light asian dressing would be good or maybe a lite balsamic vingarette.\"\\n12030,1929661,88453,2011-06-11,5,\"This is an amazing recipe!!!  I can\\'t wait to try it on some ribs.  For you guys that normally buy two bottles of your \"\"favorite bbq sauce\"\" you need to repent.  Give this recipe a try.  It is not hard to make, and the results are outstanding!!  The kids actually chewed their food.  :)\"\\n12031,167782,88453,2011-07-14,5,Everyone raved! The sauce was yummy.  I didn\\'t add the hot pepper sauce though. I also put a rub on the chicken and let it sit over night and then followed instructions as posted.\\n12032,595194,88453,2011-07-19,5,\"At first I had my doubts because of all the ketchup in the sauce, but I wanted to try it because of all the great reviews. Well, it is fantastic! I left out the celery seeds because I don\\'t really like them and I skipped the butter. We BBQ\\'ed some chickens breasts and prawns, using it to baste on the BBQ. I doubled the recipe to use some for dipping. It was really good. From now on, my DH and I will be making extra and keeping it in a bottle in the fridge to add to food spur of the moment, such as burgers.\"\\n12033,381047,88453,2011-08-26,5,\"Very good, and I love the simplicity of it.  I used the smaller amount of celery seed, but I would not recommend leaving it out--it really adds to the flavor.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!\"\\n12034,1829918,88453,2011-08-26,5,\"Great recipe. I used it on 25 Chicken Wings that I smoked on a Charcoal Grill using Mesquite and Hickory chips. I also added some preserved Lemon and Apple Cider Vinegar to the sauce. I prepared it a day in advance and it was great since all the flavors \"\"Married\"\" together.I made the wings for friends and Family at a river picnic. The wings were all devoured within no time! Thanks for a keeper recipe/Sauce!\"\\n12035,983811,88453,2011-09-05,5,\"If your looking for a good sauce for outdoor grilling, this is it!\"\\n12036,1163252,88453,2012-03-19,5,huge hit with the hubby...i love it! will make it another 50 times before getting tired of it!\\n12037,366673,88453,2012-07-29,0,this is terrific! Sauce is amazing and definitely agree you should make extra as it is great for dipping and wonderful on baked beans!! I did not use grill as it was too hot outside so I put chicken under broiler and then swathed in bbq sauce and baked. Covered with foil when browned. This will be a family summer favorite!!\\n12038,2512893,88453,2013-06-03,5,\"Great recipe.  Refreshing improvement from the bottled, sweet BBQ sauce.  I did not have hot sauce, but substituted red pepper flakes and it was sooo good.  thanks for sharing.\"\\n12039,2426491,88453,2013-09-15,5,Fantastic sauce!! We&#039;ll definitely make this again. Served with mac &amp; cheese and sweet cornbread -- a nice Southern lunch outside. YUM.\\n12040,2000115178,88453,2015-06-11,4,\"I made as is and agree with some others that I would reduce the amount of celery seed, it was a little over-powering (and I went on the low side).  The sauce was really good, not the best I&#039;ve had, but it was good and I will make it again with some tweaks.  I didn&#039;t taste any spice, so I may add some red pepper flakes or more hot sauce.  It was a bit ketchup-y for my taste.  I marinated the chicken in it the day before and the chicken was perfect, tasty and juicy - and on the Foreman Grill!\"\\n12041,2001102590,88453,2016-07-25,5,\"Delicious, just made this and i figured out a couple of things, Number 1-I will never buy store bought barbecue sauce again and Number 2-This could be eaten straight up with out putting on meat, fish, or chicken like I am doing now. It\\'s really good.\"\\n12042,2000868781,88453,2016-10-30,5,This is just fabulous! The best BBQ sauce ever.\\n12043,2001461697,88453,2017-06-29,0,Excellent! I\\'m not a fan of barbecued chicken as it is usually dry....and I haven\\'t eaten chicken skin in years....but happy to say I devoured this! Skin was crispy abd ohh so tasty...and the dipping sauce was scrumptious. A winner!\\n12044,2001675926,88453,2017-08-31,0,\"Haven\\'t tried it yet - just saw it now. Will try it, but I have a similar recipe that dates back over fifty years and the difference is that it has peanut butter in it as well. Our favorite chicken recipe! I use crunchy peanut butter and for a recipe of this size, would likely add several tablespoonfuls.\"\\n12045,945672,88453,2017-09-01,5,Very good recipe! I didn\\'t have chile sauce so I used a little extra ketchup and added about a Tbsp of molasses for sweetness. I also used celery salt in place of the celery seed and the salt. I filleted my chicken breasts so cooking time was cut down by more than half. Super tasty!\\n12046,2001569986,88453,2017-09-03,5,\"FANTASTIC!!!! The sauce is wonderful. The chicken breasts that I bought were very thick so I put them in a baking dish, topped with a little sauce, covered with foil and then baked at about 350 for about 40 minutes. Then we put them on the grill. Everything else is the exact recipe. This is the BEST grilled chicken I have ever had. THANKS.\"\\n12047,2001453193,88453,2017-09-05,2,\"I don\\'t recall chicken breasts looking like legs. I once carved breasts to look like lizards for a very interesting result when served on a stick. (: The sauce is here is good but certainly doesn\\'t live up to&quot;Best Ever&quot; I usually bypass recipes (as well as internet videos) when titled with oversell such as Unbelievable, Incredible, You MUST try this, and the like. They never live up to the hype.\"\\n12048,2002218706,88453,2018-07-15,5,Delicious.

So fast---so easy and a hit with all of us.  A definate must from now on.  Wonder how a hint of orange zest would add just a bit of zing.\\n349945,642883,259937,2008-11-01,5,Very good. We also use this with a foil boat on the bbq with salmon and steelhead.\\n349946,944337,259937,2008-12-23,5,this is the best recipe i have found for fish. my family loved it.  i can\\'t wait to try it with chicken.\\n349947,1029616,259937,2009-02-12,5,Delicious!!  My daughter and I loved this trout.  I will definitely make this again!\\n349948,998226,259937,2009-02-24,5,\"This was so moist and wonderful.  I added some pecans on the topping, will make this again.  Thanks for sharing.\"\\n349949,970865,259937,2009-05-28,5,\"We will definitely eat this again.  It was delicious--very sweet, yet not overpowering.  This was quick and easy to make.  I\\'d recommend this to anyone.\"\\n349950,1499683,259937,2010-01-20,5,\"I was a little worried going into this one because I was afraid that the recipe was going to be too sweet and ruin my beautiful fish.  I am glad that I went ahead with it, because it was SO yummy!  It was sweet, but not overly sweet, and it complimented the fish nicely.  My family enjoyed it very much, so I will definitely be making this one again!\"\\n349951,76733,259937,2010-03-12,5,My husband hates it when I try new recipes but he loved this one!

The flavor is great and it is sweet but not too sweet.  The garlic adds just the right amount of savory.\"\\n349953,1308754,259937,2010-04-30,5,\"This is absolutely delicious.  Not overly sweet and the fish didn\\'t get dried out.  I added a few more cloves of garlic.. Mmmm, perfect!\"\\n349954,222478,259937,2010-06-20,5,Wonderful!
